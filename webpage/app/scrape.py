# Scrape time and location.

# Make scraping faster and more efficient
# incorporate database and get rid of only getting 10 events.
# Make regex checking time more efficient/intuitive. 
# some blitz_dates not showing up
# Talks and Discussions not opening
# let multiple sections be open
# do we need to add new categories to blitz-machine.html at the bottom with .click() and .show() and hide() - for reminder just look in this file
# Make sure November 9 does not show up as 9pm.

# Recognize 11th as a date.
# Finding time but not printing correctly
